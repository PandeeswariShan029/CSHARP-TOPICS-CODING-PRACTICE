You are tasked to create a library system using C# that uses generic collections (List<T>) to manage books. The program should interact with the user to add books to the library and display all the book details using a function within the Library class.

Requirements:

Create a Book class to represent book details with the following properties:

Title (string): The title of the book.
Author (string): The author of the book.
YearPublished (int): The year the book was published.
Create a Library class to manage books using a generic collection List<Book>. The Library class should have the following methods:

AddBook(Book book): Adds a book to the library.
DisplayAllBooks(): Displays all the book details in the library, including title, author, and year published.
Implement a separate function to get book details from the user. This function should prompt the user for the title, author, and year published of the book and return a Book object with the provided details.

Sample Input/Output:

yaml
Copy code
Add books to the library:
Book 1:
Title: The Hobbit
Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
Year Published: 1937
Book 2:
Title: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
Author: J.K. Rowling
Year Published: 1997
Book 3:
Title: To Kill a Mockingbird
Author: Harper Lee
Year Published: 1960

Displaying all books in the library:
Title: The Hobbit, Author: J.R.R. Tolkien, Year Published: 1937
Title: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Author: J.K. Rowling, Year Published: 1997
Title: To Kill a Mockingbird, Author: Harper Lee, Year Published: 1960
Your task is to implement the Library system according to the requirements above. Use generic collections (List<T>) to manage the books efficiently. Good luck!
